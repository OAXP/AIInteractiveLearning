# AI Interactive Learning - Prototype Équipe 3 IND8137A
## Description
This project is a prototype for the course IND8137A at Polytechnique Montréal. The goal of this project is to offer a memorizing or learning platform mainly for students. They can upload a PDF file of anything they want to learn about (could be a course) and an AI will generate the number of questions that the user chose. The user will then be able to answer the questions and get a feedback on their answer, if it's wrong it will also give ways to improve the answer to avoid making the same mistake.
